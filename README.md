### Client / User server

##### it is very important to understand how to communicate with this server as a client, so the instruction should follow after starting the server

ðŸ”³ This is not some fancy react frontend code as I am a backend developer ðŸ˜…... so you'd run it in your browser console

- Open Browser
  -Open the browser console using <b>CTRL + SHIFT + I</b>

Input this line of Javascript code:

- First

```
let socket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3000/chat")
```

- Next

```
socket.onmessage = event => { console.log("chat server: ", event.data)}
```

With the above code, you're already connected with the server and ready to chat

### To chat Bot :

-

```
socket.send("Hello Bot :)")
```

### To Chat Broadcast / GC

- send regular text using the :

```
socket.send("any text that goes")
```
